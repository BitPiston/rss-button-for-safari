# RSS Button for Safari
A native app extension written in Swift for Safari 12+ adding feed discovery via toolbar button. 

Inspired by Syndicate by Reda Lemeden:

Motiviation thanks to Apple depreciating Safari JS extensions and making Safari 12 the last version to support them:

## Installation & Usage

RSS Button for Safari can be purchased from the Mac App Store:  

<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rss-button-for-safari/id1437501942?ls=1&mt=12"><img src="https://rss-extension.bitpiston.com/img/appstore-130x38@2x.png" width="130" height="38"></a>

Why isn't it free? The only reason is to cover the cost of the Apple Developer Program fee required to distribute the application and extension via MAS.

Alternatively you can checkout the source and build the application and extension yourself allowing unsigned extensions from the develop menu in Safari.
